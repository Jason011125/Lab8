# Lab 8 - Starter
Q1:
<br>
I would fit it in option1, as it will automatically test my program and output the test result for some basic cases.
<br>
Q2:<br>
No. Since end to end is used to check whether the whole program is working, not for a particular function.
<br>
Q3:<br>

No. Unit testing is only used to test the smallest possible fragment of the code, the messaging function in a messaging application is a bigpart of the code for that application
<br>
Q4:<br>
Yes. The max message length is a very small fragment of the code that we can test, so unit testing would aboslutely work in this case, as a simple true or false test case can help us test this unit of code.
